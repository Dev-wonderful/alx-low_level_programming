# Debugging

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Africa**. It aims to learn how to debug in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 12.1.0`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-main.c` | Test that function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0` |
| `1-main.c` | Fixed program to the infinite loop |
| `2-largest_number.c` | Prints the largest of three integers |
| `3-print_remaining_days.c` | Converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year |
